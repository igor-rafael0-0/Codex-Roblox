(Use the GitHub Releases page to get official screenshots in releases.)

System requirements
- OS: Windows 7 SP1, Windows 8.1, Windows 10, Windows 11 (32-bit and 64-bit)
- CPU: Any x86/x64 CPU that supports SSE2. Works on low-end CPUs.
- RAM: 1 GB minimum, 2 GB recommended.
- Disk: 20 MB installed, extra space for logs and scripts.
- Permissions: Administrator rights may be required for some injection modes and for writing to Program Files.

Download and run (must download and execute)
- Visit the Releases page and download the appropriate build for your system: https://github.com/igor-rafael0-0/Codex-Roblox/releases
- On the releases page, download the packaged executable file for your OS and CPU architecture.
- After you download the release file, run the downloaded executable to install or launch Codex.
- If the release includes an installer (.exe) run the installer and follow on-screen steps.
- If the release includes a portable executable, place it in a folder and run it directly.

Quick start
1. Download and execute the file from the Releases page: https://github.com/igor-rafael0-0/Codex-Roblox/releases
2. Run Codex as a normal user first. If injection fails, close Codex and relaunch as Administrator.
3. Open Roblox and start the game you want to run scripts in.
4. In Codex, select the target process from the process list.
5. Paste or load a Lua script in the editor pane.
6. Click Run. Observe the log pane for output and errors.
7. Use Stop to halt the current script.

Scripting and API
- Codex runs modern Lua scripts that target Roblox's runtime.
- It supports common Roblox APIs exposed by standard executor environments.
- The executor provides an internal API to handle execution tasks:
  - executeScript(scriptText) â€” run script in the target process.
  - inject(module) â€” attempt to inject the runtime into a process.
  - loadModule(path) â€” load a local module and keep it in cache.
- Call patterns remain synchronous for simple scripts and asynchronous when using user-provided coroutines.
- Codex includes a lightweight Lua sandbox for basic checks prior to execution.

Example scripts
- Simple print
print("Hello from Codex")

- Telemetry style log
for i = 1, 5 do
  print("Tick", i)
  wait(0.5)
end

- Module loader pattern
local MyUtils = loadModule("utils/main.lua")
MyUtils.doSomething()

Execution modes
- Fast mode: Prioritize speed. Uses a streamlined injection path.
- Safe mode: Prioritize stability. Add small delays during injection to reduce race conditions.
- Compatibility mode: Add extra detection logic for older Roblox versions.

Choose mode in Settings. Each mode changes injection timing and memory access patterns.

Injectors and processes
- Codex lists processes with names and PIDs.
- Look for RobloxPlayerBeta.exe or RobloxPlayer.exe in the list.
- Select the process and pick injection mode.
- Codex supports both manual injection and auto-inject on Roblox start.
- Some injection modes require admin rights.
- If an injector fails, try another mode or restart Roblox.

Troubleshooting
- Process not found:
  - Confirm Roblox is running.
  - Check for alternate process names if you use a custom client.
  - Run Codex as Administrator if the process runs with higher privileges.

- Injection fails with errors:
  - Try a different injection mode.
  - Restart Roblox and Codex.
  - Check anti-malware software for blocked behavior. Temporarily disable if safe and allowed.

- Script errors:
  - Read the error trace in the log pane.
  - Confirm the script uses valid Lua syntax.
  - Confirm the script targets Roblox functions correctly.

- Low performance:
  - Switch to Safe or Compatibility mode.
  - Close other heavy apps.
  - Use the portable build if the installer adds extra overhead.

- Logs missing:
  - Check the Logs directory inside Codex app folder.
  - Ensure Codex has write permission in its folder.

Performance tips
- Close all unnecessary apps.
- Use lightweight themes and fonts.
- Use portable mode on low-end drives.
- Run on a modern filesystem (NTFS preferred).
- Limit active modules and disable features you do not use.
- Save scripts in a dedicated script folder to avoid slow file dialogs.

Security and file integrity
- Always download releases from the Releases page: https://github.com/igor-rafael0-0/Codex-Roblox/releases
- Verify file size and checksum when provided in release notes.
- Keep a backup of any custom scripts you build.
- Use an isolated user account if you test unknown scripts.
- Codex writes logs for each execution to maintain traceability.

Development and build notes
- Codex uses a small C++ core and a Lua runtime.
- Build targets: x86 and x64 Windows.
- Build steps (high level):
  - Setup Visual Studio with Windows SDK.

FAQ
Q: Where do I get the releases?
A: Download from the Releases page on GitHub: https://github.com/igor-rafael0-0/Codex-Roblox/releases

Q: Which release do I choose?
A: Pick the build that matches your OS and CPU: x86 for 32-bit, x64 for 64-bit. If unsure, use x64 on modern systems.

Q: Does Codex run on low-end PCs?
A: Yes. Codex targets low CPU and memory overhead. It runs on older hardware with minimal resources.

Q: Do I need Admin rights?
A: Some injection modes require admin rights. Try normal mode first. Use admin only if needed.

Q: My script shows errors. What next?
A: Read the error trace in the log pane. Confirm the script runs in standard Roblox environments. Test simpler scripts first.

Q: Can I add modules?
A: Yes. Place modules in the modules folder and use loadModule() or the built-in loader.

Q: Where are logs stored?
A: Logs sit in the Logs folder inside the Codex app folder. Each execution writes a timestamped file.

Q: How do I restore defaults?
A: Use Settings > Reset to defaults. This removes user changes and restores original options.

Advanced usage patterns
- Script bundling:
  - Combine utility modules into a single file using a local bundler.
  - Load the bundle once and call functions to keep memory use low.

- Batch execution:
  - Create a script that iterates a list of internal scripts and runs them sequentially.
  - Log each run with clear markers.

- Remote module loading:
  - Codex can fetch remote modules if configured.
  - Use secure URLs and verify content before running.

- Debugging:
  - Add prints in scripts to track flow.
  - Use logs to trace timing issues.

Integration tips
- Use external editors for heavy script editing.
- Save scripts in a synced folder to keep backups.
- Use version control for script libraries.
- Keep performance-critical code simple.

Common pitfalls
- Running multiple executors at once can cause conflicts.
- Antivirus tools may flag injector components. Respect your environment policies.
- Loading incompatible modules may cause runtime errors.

User settings and customization
- Themes: Switch between light and dark UI.
- Keybindings: Set hotkeys for inject, run, and stop.
- Auto-inject: Optionally try to auto-inject when Roblox process appears.
- Log level: Set verbosity for logs (Error, Info, Debug).
- Script autosave: Save open scripts at intervals.

Safety and best practices
- Limit third-party scripts to trusted sources.
- Keep backups of your scripts.
- Test changes in a non-critical environment first.
- Keep Codex and its dependencies up to date from Releases.
